# AngularCharactersheetApi

So i had an idea to create an application for adding and editing Warhammer RPG Character Sheets
You know, something similar to Dungeons & Dragons, where you create your own character

This project is one of my first Angular projects so please don't judge me too harshly, i was just learning

Right now im creating brand new angular app dedicated to this idea because i feel that i know something but i will leave this one here, why not
